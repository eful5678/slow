# final

## Concept

- the final keyword is used in several contexts to define an entity that can only be assigned once.

## Advantages

- Immutable Objects
  - You can share duplicates by pointing them to a single instance.
- Security
  - The system can hand out sensitive bits of read-only information without worrying that they will be altered.
- Performance
  - Immutable data is very useful in making things thread-safe.
